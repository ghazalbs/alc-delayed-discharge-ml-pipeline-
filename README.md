Responsible Artificial Intelligence for Predicting Delayed Hospital Discharge Among Older Adults: Balancing Accuracy, Equity, and Explainability

# Reproducibility
Due to ICES data access restrictions, this repository does not contain runnable code
or data. Instead, it provides a high-level, parameterized R script skeleton
(`reproducibility_skeleton.R`) documenting the full analysis pipeline, including
model development, calibration, fairness evaluation, and explainability.
